# Standard ML Utilities Illustration
EDA and model validation utilities for a standard classification problem.

## Introduction
In this repository, we tackle the problem of analyzing the demographic of people who
survived the titanic incident using the _titanic_ dataset. 

We demonstrate the use of utilities for EDA and some for model validation we have developed over previous projects. 

## Installation
The packages we have used here are quite standard and should be available to most users familiar with Python. 
However, to replicate the exact behavior, please utilize the `requirements.txt` file to create a virtual environment. 

Note: For this exercise, we have used Python 3.8.8. 
```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv titanic_venv
source titanic_venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
